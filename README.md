This program imitates the cp unix command. It can either accept two files as input to copy file1 to file2,
or it can accept any number of files to copy followed by a directory name as a destination.
Any other input should print an error message.
System calls such as open, read, and write are used to create, overwrite, open, read and write to files.
Files can be a variety of types including csv, jpg, txt, bin, etc.
